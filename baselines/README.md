# Baseline Images Directory

This directory contains baseline images for visual regression testing.

## How to generate baselines:

1. Run your E2E tests first to capture screenshots
2. Review the screenshots in `.artifacts/screenshots/`
3. Copy approved screenshots to this `baselines/` directory
4. Future test runs will compare against these baselines

## Naming convention:
- Use the same filename as generated by the E2E tests
- Example: `login-initial.png`, `dashboard-view.png`

## Updating baselines:
When intentional UI changes are made:
1. Run tests to capture new screenshots
2. Review the differences
3. If changes are correct, copy new screenshots here to update baselines
