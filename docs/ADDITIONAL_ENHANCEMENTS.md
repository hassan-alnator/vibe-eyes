# üí° Additional Enhancement Suggestions

This document collects further recommendations to elevate the Eyes MCP Server beyond its current roadmap. These suggestions focus on Developer Experience, CI/CD integration, performance, accessibility, extensibility, documentation, visual diff UX, and test‚Äëstrategy improvements.

## Developer Experience
- Provide a seamless CLI wrapper and a typed TypeScript client for local and CI invocations.
- Publish an npm package with proper semantic versioning, a changelog, and auto‚Äëgenerated API docs.
- Add cookbook-style examples in `examples/` showcasing common workflows: unit-only, E2E+visual, and OCR validation.

## Quality Gates & Tooling
- Enforce linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and type checks via pre‚Äëcommit hooks.
- Define unit-test coverage thresholds and fail the build on regressions.
- Add CI status, coverage, and npm-version badge shields to the README.

## CI/CD & Reporting
- Provide ready-to-use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI templates for running the full test suites.
- Integrate Slack or Microsoft Teams notifications for test failures and coverage drops.
- Persist historical test metrics (execution times, flakiness rates) in a simple dashboard or artifact storage.

## Performance & Scalability
- Implement parallel E2E execution using multiple browser contexts or worker threads.
- Allow selective test grouping/tags to execute only impacted flows in CI.
- Cache intermediate artifacts (OCR outputs, baseline images) to speed up repeated runs.

## Accessibility & Compliance
- Integrate axe-core for automated WCAG accessibility checks as an optional E2E step.
- Generate accessibility reports highlighting violations alongside visual differences.

## Extensibility & Plugin Model
- Offer a plugin API so the community can hook in external tools (e.g., Lighthouse, Percy).
- Document how to author and register new ‚Äútools‚Äù under `src/tools/` with examples.

## Documentation & UX polish
- Auto-generate API reference from TypeScript types (e.g., via TypeDoc).
- Consolidate setup guides (CLAUDE, Playwright, Ollama) into a single quickstart.
- Add architecture diagrams to `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` to illustrate the data-flow between tools.

## Visual Diff User Experience
- Build a minimal web UI for approving or rejecting visual diffs (roadmap item).
- Support masking dynamic regions (timestamps, ads) via JSON metadata.
- Integrate a side-by-side diff viewer with zoom, pan, and annotation capabilities.

## Test Strategy Enhancements
- Provide test-data management utilities (DB seed/reset) in E2E flows.
- Offer built-in mocks for common third‚Äëparty services (auth, payments).
- Add snapshot testing for component UIs (React/Vue) using the existing visual engine.
